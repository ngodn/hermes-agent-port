# Hermes Rust rewrite

Full rewrite of hermes-agent from Python to Rust. Goal: lower memory/startup
footprint and a single deployable binary. Strategy is strangler-fig, not
big-bang: we stand up Rust components one at a time behind the boundaries that
already exist in the Python codebase, keep everything running, and stay in
sync with upstream by pinning a known commit as the porting spec.

## Layout

```
rust/
  Cargo.toml            workspace
  crates/
    hermes-core/        shared types + error (no async, no IO)
    hermes-gateway/     the long-lived network process (first target)
```

## Phase order

1. **Gateway** (`crates/hermes-gateway`) — the long-lived, latency-sensitive,
   most self-contained process. Ports `gateway/`. *In progress.*
2. **Tool runtime + RPC host** — tool-calling layer and subprocess/RPC plumbing.
3. **State + search** — `hermes_state*.py`, `hermes_state_search.py` onto
   rusqlite + FTS5 (reuse the existing C ext in `native/fts5_cjk/`).
4. **Agent core loop** — `run_agent.py`. Last, once contracts are frozen.
5. **TUI / web frontend** — left in TS/React unless there's a reason to move it.

## Stack mapping

| Python            | Rust                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| asyncio           | tokio                        |
| httpx / aiohttp   | reqwest / hyper              |
| fastapi / uvicorn | axum                         |
| pydantic          | serde (+ validator)          |
| sqlite3 + FTS5    | rusqlite (keep C FTS5 ext)   |
| prompt_toolkit    | ratatui + crossterm          |
| jinja2            | minijinja                    |
| croniter          | tokio-cron-scheduler / cron  |

## Gateway status

- [x] Workspace + toolchain + build
- [x] Server skeleton (axum) with `/healthz`, `/readyz`, graceful shutdown
- [x] Env-driven config (`HERMES_GATEWAY_BIND`)
- [ ] Agent RPC boundary (client to the Python agent, then native)
- [ ] Platform adapters: Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal
- [ ] Session lifecycle + delivery ledger
- [ ] Control socket / drain control
```
```

## Running

```bash
cd rust
cargo run -p hermes-gateway          # serves on 127.0.0.1:8787 by default
HERMES_GATEWAY_BIND=0.0.0.0:8080 cargo run -p hermes-gateway
```
